<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
<p>This project is an MVC web application that serves as a mock car insurance website.
  It takes user's input and calculates a quote based on business logic.  There is also
  and admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>


<h3>Black Jack</h3>
<p>This project utilizes C# algorithms to create a functioning Black Jack card game.  
  There are "Try/Catch" statements to help with error handling, as well as a connected database to 
  keep track of player information.  On top of that, there is custom dialog to make it feel like
  an old west text based card game!</p>
