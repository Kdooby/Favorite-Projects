<h3>Academy Cinemas</h3>
<p>Academy Cinemas is a sample webpage for a movie theater.  It shows the current movies, descriptions and start times, 
  as well as a modal registration form. This is all done using HTML and Bootstrap.
  
<h3>Another Insurance Company</h3>
<p>This project is an MVC web application that serves as a mock car insurance website.
  It takes user's input and calculates a quote based on business logic.  There is also
  and admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>  
  
<h3>Black Jack</h3>
<p>This project utilizes C# algorithms to create a functioning Black Jack card game.  
  There are "Try/Catch" statements to help with error handling, as well as a connected database to 
  keep track of player information.  On top of that, there is custom dialog to make it feel like
  an old west text based card game!</p>
  
<h3>Movie Database</h3>
